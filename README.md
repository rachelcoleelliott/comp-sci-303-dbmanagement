Computer Science 303: Database Management

In this Database Management project, as per the class project details, I was asked to:

1. Selection of a database
2. Identifying the requirements for the database based on the purpose for the database and the data to fill the database
3. Creating a database design based on the requirements for the database: create the physical database and load data into the database
4. Carrying out sample queries that would be performed on the actual database, then showing the results of the sample queries

This project will consist of a series of steps defined in the prompts of the assignment. Some of the prompts are necessary to properly prepare for the manipulation of the database whereas others will be necessary for you to complete to demonstrate your competence with the concepts of this topic. The answers to these prompts will be examined against the actual expected answers to the prompt. All prompts that will be assessed against a answer key, meaning that you will get either full, partial, or no points per prompt.
